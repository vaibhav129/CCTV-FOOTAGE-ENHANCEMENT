# CCTV-FOOTAGE-ENHANCEMENT

A criminal investigation may be thought of as a set of questions: who was engaged in an event, where did it occur, what occurred, when did it occur, why did it occur, and how were any crimes committed. A high-quality video might allow investigators to observe an entire incident develop in full, revealing details such as the order of events, the tactics utilised, and the offender's access and leave routes. Even if this isn't feasible, CCTV footage may be valuable in correlating or disputing other evidence of what occurred

Image improvement is a focus of our research, we planned to promote the notion of boosting CCTV video because high-quality film or images would help investigators better grasp the case. we used four techniques to improve the images:

1)Successive Mean Quantization Transform(SMQT):
2)Low light image enhancement
3)Wiener Filter
4)4)Morphological operators
